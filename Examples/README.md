## Getting Started
After cloning the repository or downloading and expanding the zip file, navigate to the Examples directory and open the Examples.xcworkspace file. Each of the example projects consist of a target for an iOS mobile app and a corresponding server module. Each server module is associated with the **Perfect Server HTTP App** permitting it to be launched directly from within Xcode. By default, the server will listen on localhost on port **8181** and each example iOS app will attempt to contact the local server on that port. If you need to change this port, it can be done in the settings for the HTTP App and in the source code for each iOS app.
